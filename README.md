The source code used in paper "Towards Empty Answers in SPARQL: Approximating Querying with RDF Embedding"

Dateset: DBpedia english version. Training the hole dataset will cost you too much time. You can use SPARQL to extract a subset, and then feed it to the embedding model.

Twenty failing queries are reported in "failing queries.xlsx";
